# Clustering-of-various-mental-health-disorders

## Overview
This project aims to apply clustering algorithms to group individuals based on symptoms and characteristics associated with various mental health disorders. Clustering helps identify patterns and similarities among individuals, which can assist in improving diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of these disorders.

## Clustering Algorithms
1. K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarities in feature space. It minimizes the within-cluster variance to assign data points to the nearest cluster centroid.

2. Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering
Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that starts with each data point as a separate cluster and merges clusters iteratively based on a linkage criterion (e.g., Ward, average, complete) until reaching a specified number of clusters or a desired clustering structure.

3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are closely packed, defining clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. It is robust to outliers and does not require specifying the number of clusters a priori.

4. Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering is a graph-based clustering technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space using spectral decomposition techniques. It then applies traditional clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) in the transformed space to identify clusters based on similarity.

## Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric used for assessing clustering quality is the Silhouette Score. The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher silhouette scores indicate better clustering structures with well-defined clusters.

## Results and Insights
After applying clustering algorithms and evaluating using the silhouette score, insights can be gained:

1. Identification of distinct clusters representing different mental health profiles.
2. Exploration of common symptoms or characteristics within each cluster.
3. Comparison of clustering performance across different algorithms based on silhouette scores.
